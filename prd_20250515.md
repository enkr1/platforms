This PRD will detail concepts for dynamic backgrounds, interactive platform links, typography, and micro-interactions, keeping GitHub Pages compatibility and performance in mind. We can then tackle these features step-by-step, ensuring a cohesive and impressive result.

Based on the analysis of your requirements and the current codebase, I'll draft a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for enhancing your Spotify integration with a futuristic, minimalist design that's compatible with GitHub Pages:

**1. Core Features & Design Philosophy**
- Minimalist, futuristic interface with subtle 3D elements
- Performance-optimized animations and effects
- GitHub Pages compatible implementation
- Mobile-first responsive design

**2. Visual Design Components**

*Phase 1: Essential UI Enhancement*
- Modern glassmorphism effect for the currently playing container
- Smooth hover transitions and micro-interactions
- Custom loading animations
- Minimalist error states with artistic flair

*Phase 2: Advanced Features*
- 3D album art rotation on hover
- Particle system background that reacts to music presence
- Progress indicator with futuristic visualization
- Custom typography with dynamic scaling

**3. Technical Implementation Plan**

*Stage 1: Foundation (Current Focus)*
- Implement base styling with CSS variables for theming
- Add basic animations using CSS transforms
- Optimize current HTML structure
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

*Stage 2: Advanced Features*
- Integrate Three.js for 3D effects (optional, based on performance)
- Implement WebGL-based visualizations
- Add advanced interaction patterns
- Progressive enhancement for modern browsers

**4. Performance Considerations**
- Lazy loading for images and heavy assets
- CSS animation optimization
- Minimal dependency on external libraries
- Progressive enhancement approach

**5. Browser & Platform Support**
- Modern browsers (last 2 versions)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fallback designs for older browsers

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with Stage 1 of the implementation, and we can start enhancing the current Spotify integration with these modern design elements step by step.
